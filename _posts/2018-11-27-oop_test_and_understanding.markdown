Object oriented programming can be challenging at first. As you aren't use to what it is. It takes time and research to get what you are really doing is creating virtual objects of real world objects into programming. It takes really understanding you are really making changes to strings that represent real world object. Those virtual objects doesnt actually work like real world but you have to program it to mimic is to some extent via behaviors and states. Its a way to trick your mind to thinking it actually exist.
