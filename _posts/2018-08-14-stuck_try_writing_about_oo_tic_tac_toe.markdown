 I think one needs to sometimes re-read materials and then try again. Also seek out other sources of information like websites and youtube because some of the information is harder to describe and get the first time. Given enough time do that several times will help one eventually get to the solution. Keep it up and stay commited. Motivation will wane but give it a break here and there and come back strong. Everytime wasnt made just on motivation but sustain persistance and commitment.
