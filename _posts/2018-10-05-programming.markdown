Programming is challenging and sometimes you need to do things over and over again. Printing it out and seeing the whole picture is helpful. Sometimes you have to take long breaks after hard charging for a while. Doubt does set in but persistence will eventually be what you need to give to hang in. I was working through that phase and I will be back soon charging again.
